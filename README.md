## Installation

To use Closures+, you **must** have a userscript manager browser extension installed, such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.

1.  **Install a Userscript Manager:** If you don't have one, choose one compatible with your browser:
    * [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera)
    * [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox)
    * Violentmonkey (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera)
2.  **Install Closures+:**
    * Click here to install directly from [**GitHub**](YOUR_GITHUB_RAW_INSTALL_LINK_HERE)
3.  Your userscript manager should prompt you to confirm the installation. Accept the prompt.
4.  Once installed, Closures+ will automatically be active the next time you load or refresh the Waze Map Editor.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the Waze Map Editor at [**waze.com/editor**](https://www.waze.com/editor).
2.  Ensure the Closures+ script is enabled in your userscript manager.
3.  Interact with the script's features directly within the WME interface. Look for enhancements in standard locations, such as:
    * The **scripts sidebar/menu**.
    * The **closures editing panel** when segments or turns are selected.
    * New buttons or visual cues on the map or segment list.
4.  The specific steps might vary depending on the task you want to achieve (e.g., creating a single closure, applying a template, bulk editing). The goal is for interactions to be intuitive and feel integrated with the standard WME workflow.
